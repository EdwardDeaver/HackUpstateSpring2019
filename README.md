Inspiration:
I like synthesizers and I pivoted three times before this.

What it does:
Takes the color data, latitude and longitude of the Centro path data to make noise in their respective oscillators.

How I built it:
I used a node server dev environment. I switched from plotting the project on leaflet to p5 waveform because leaflet acts strange with async data.

Challenges I ran into:

*I didn't know P5.

*Chrome blocks autoplaying noise.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
Being able to draw a "waveform" of the oscillator 2

What I learned:
P5 JS oscillators.

Built With:

*p5

*stae
